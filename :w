### Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to allow students to have acess to courses/modules that will allow them to learn any place, any time, and at their own pace.

The seocundary goal is to expand the Catapult program.
This is built as a sister program to Catapult, expanding the reach of Nextech and providing valuable resources to students further than the Catapult program is built to handle.
Students will be able to learn and grow ther skills both pre and post Catapult, or even without ever participatiing in Catapult.
