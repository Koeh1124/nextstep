## Overvieow

### Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to allow students to have acess to courses/modules that will allow them to learn any place, any time, and at their own pace.

The seocundary goal is to expand the Catapult program.
This is built as a sister program to Catapult, expanding the reach of Nextech and providing valuable resources to students further than the Catapult program is built to handle.
Students will be able to learn and grow ther skills both pre and post Catapult, or even without ever participatiing in Catapult.

## Modules

Each modlue is in one of three categories

1. [Languages](./Modules/language_modules/LANGUAGES.md)
2. [Topics](./Modules/topic_modules/TOPICS.md)
3. [Projects](./Modules/project_modules/PROJECTS.md)

Ecah of these module types have their own section in this documentation goes over the general structure that a module should follow, current modlues that exits for that category, and a backlog of modules.

### General purpose of each module type

Languages:

These are meant to introduce the students to a programming language.
Showing them how to do things like define a variable, define a function, make an object, import a library, etc.
These should be made to be ever expanding as each language will always be changing and expanding as well.
Along with the language itself, these modules may also have portions that will cover popular libraies and tools in that language.
These tool may also be built into more full modules in the Topic category for the modules.
For example in a python language module there may be a section focusing on numpy or the typing module, but those more than likely would be kept to just that section.
But a libray like Pandas or Flask would be made into their own toic libray as they are so big and used to do very specific tasks in python (data science and writing APIs/websites)

Topics:

These are built out to cover a specific topic such as APIs, data structurs and algorithms, data science, etc.
Think of these like a CS class, they won't introduce you to a language but rather how to use that language to solve specific problems.
These modules will also have multiple versions of them covering the same material, but in diffrent languages.
This will allow the students to go through the content in the language that they are most comfterable with.
This does depend on the language also of course, we can't have a module covering object-oriented programming in C because C does not have objects.

Projects:

As the name suggests these are projects that the students can make and show off on a portfolio or resume.
These are the what the language and topic modules come together to make.
Of couse a student can complete these without doing the language and topic modules as the modules can all be done in whatever order the student wants to do.
However, there will be a list of suggested modules that the student completes before doing the project as the project will rely on the material those modles contain.
It's good practice to build out any prerequisite modules before building out the project that relies on them to make it easier on students.
